# Architecture Overview

High-level system flow:
```
React Frontend -> (REST) NestJS Backend -> MySQL (Dockerized)
```
## Backend Design
- Controller layer handles requests
- Service layer contains business logic
- Explicit avatar lifecycle handling
- DTO validation with transformation
- Soft delete via TypeORM

Avatar handling strategy:
- Database stores relative path only
- API returns full URL dynamically
- Client never controls avatarUrl directly

## Frontend Design
- Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Modal, DataTable)
- Feature-based structure
- React Query for server state
- Form abstraction with RHF
- Controlled FormData handling for file uploads

---

# Soft Delete

Referrals are soft deleted using TypeORM’s soft delete functionality.
Deleted records are excluded from normal queries.

---

# Responsiveness

- Mobile-first form layout
- Responsive table
- Adaptive modals
- Works across screen sizes

---

# Key Technical Decisions

- Server-side pagination for scalability
- Explicit file lifecycle management
- Nullable database column with strict TypeScript typing
- Separation of Create vs Update DTO validation strictness
- Behavior-driven frontend testing
- Clean transformation of multipart boolean values

---

# Notes

- Avatar files are stored locally in /uploads
- Only backend constructs avatarUrl
- FormData used consistently for create & update
- Designed for maintainability and clarity
